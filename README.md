# Robotic Vacuum Sensor Simulation

This project was developed as part of an academic course assignment.  
It simulates a robotic vacuum using a **Java microservices framework** with:

- **Threads, concurrency, synchronization, and a message bus**  
- Microservices for **Camera, LiDAR, and GPS/IMU sensors**  
- A **Fusion-SLAM module** for real-time environment mapping  
- **Design Patterns** (Message Loop, Singleton, Publish/Subscribe)  
- **Git, Docker, Maven** for development and testing  
- **JUnit with TDD** for robust unit testing  

The system produces **JSON outputs** containing statistics and global environment maps,  
while ensuring efficient parallel execution and fault handling of sensor services.
